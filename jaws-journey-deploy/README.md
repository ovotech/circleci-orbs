# Smart Journeys (JAWS) Standard CircleCI Deployment

This orb provides a standard deployment process for all journey repositories to ensure common code between them.

### Making Updates
To update this orb, simply make the required changes, and then increment the version number in the orb_version.txt file

### Jobs

Available Jobs
* [checkout-code](#checkout-code)
* [build-and-test](#build-and-test)

All the available jobs apart from checkout-code will notify of failure via a slack message.  For more info go to [slack-notification](#slack-notification) section.

### checkout-code

**Description**

This circleci job checks out your repositories code, and persists it to a working directory

**Parameters**

Does not require any parameters to be provided

### avro

**Description**

This job performs two steps for the journey code bases.  
 1. Firstly it checks whether the version of the schema that the code would produce is compatible with the version of the schema currently in Aiven, 
 2. Uploads the schema to Aiven's schema registry. This feature is optional and can be switched off with `uploadschema` parameter

**Note** If you are not uploading the schema then the compatibility check will handle instances of the schema not being found in the schema registry.  This is to allow for testing without having to commit the schema 

**Parameters**

* uploadschema: Boolean value expected, which indicates whether you want to run the upload avro step.  Default value is false
* environment: Indicates to the build step which properties file to run against.  Expected values are `[sandbox, nonprod, prod]`

### build-and-test

**Description**

This job performs a few steps
1. Runs a gradle build on the service provided in `serviceName` parameter
2. Run unit tests
3. Saves the results of the unit tests to be used for code coverage
4. Publishes docker image to AWS ECR - if `publish` parameter is set to true

**Parameters**

* serviceName: Which service within the repo are you wanting to build
* environment: Indicates to the build step which properties file to run against.  Expected values are `[sandbox, nonprod, prod]`
* publish: Indicates whether you want to upload the resulting Docker image to AWS ECR
* skipUnitTests: If set to true, will run gradle with `-x test`

### lib-build-and-test

**Description**

This job will build the provided lib project, the reason for this step is to allow Code Coverage to report on tests within libs.  It runs exactly the same steps as [build-and-test](#build-and-test)
**Parameters**
* lib: The name of the lib project to be built

### integration-test

**Description**

This job executes integration tests for the supplied service

**Parameters**

* serviceName: Which service within the repo are you wanting to build
* environment: Indicates to the build step which properties file to run against.  Expected values are `[sandbox, nonprod, prod]`

### run-automation-test

**Description**


**Parameters**

* `environment` - indicates to the build step which properties file to run against.  Expected values are [sandbox, nonprod, prod]

### synk-scan

Performs a check to make sure your code dependencies do not introduce any new security vulnerabilities 

**Parameters**

Does not require any parameters passed through.

**CircleCI Environment Variables**
* SNYK_TOKEN: API Token used to communicate with Snyk

### tf-plan
**Description**

This step performs a linting step to make sure the terraform styling is in a standardised format, and then runs a terraform plan - based on the files provided in the path parameter.

**Parameters**
* attach_workspace: Boolean field to indicate whether you want to attach to the workspace 'working'.  This is defaulted to false, and is only used for the template build.
* path: The path of the terraform files you are wanting to run against - **Note** remember to omit the root terraform directory from your path.  As shown in the hierarchy example below Journeys will typically contain a main and kubernetes subfolder.
* environment: Indicates which environment the code is being deployed to.  Expected values are `[sandbox, nonprod, prod]`

```
terraform
└───kubernetes
│   │   kubernetes1.tf
│   │   kubernetes2.tf
│   │
│   └───modules
│       │   exmaple3.tf
│       │   example4.tf
│       │   ...
│   
└───main
    │   service1.tf
    │   service2.tf
```

### tf-apply

**Description**

This step performs a linting step to make sure the terraform styling is standardised, and then runs a terraform apply - based on the files provided in the path parameter.

**Parameters**
* path: The path of the terraform files you are wanting to run against - **Note** remember to omit the root terraform directory from your path.  As shown in the hierarchy example below Journeys will typically contain a main and kubernetes subfolder.
* environment: Indicates which environment the code is being deployed to.  Expected values are `[sandbox, nonprod, prod]`

### notify-shipit

**Description**

Send a message to shipit API to indicate when a deployment has occurred

**Parameters**

Does not require any parameters passed through.  However it does require that you provide a SHIPIT_API_KEY within the project environment variables or context

### report-code-coverage
**Description**

This step generates a code coverage report and adds to your GitHub PR as comments.  To generate the report, the step [build-and-test](#build-and-test) need to of already completed.
 
**Parameters**

Does not require any parameters to be passed.  It does however need the following environment variables to be set `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_BOT_PACKAGE_MANAGER_TOKEN`

### Slack Notification
**Description**
This step will send a slack notification when a build step fails.  This is to increase visibility of failures to the development team.

These are configured in CircleCI contexts - described below.

To run the slack notification we implemented the steps in the [developers setup guide](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/slack-orb/wiki/Setup#4-create-a-context-on-circleci).  For CircleCi you just need to make sure you are passing the following environment variables
- SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN
- SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL - to get the channel Id it is easier to open slack in a web browser as you can see the channel Id in the url  
- SLACK_INTEGRATION_ENABLED - toggle whether to run slack notification steps (true/false)

### create-release
**Description**
This step implements [semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to automatically create the following
* Github Release tag
* Release notes
* ChangeLog
To automatically create these you need to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
