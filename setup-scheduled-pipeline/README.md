# CircleCI Scheduled Trigger Creation orb

This orb is responsible for setting up schedules for [scheduled pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/scheduled-pipelines/#get-started). Previously the only way to do this was via the [CircleCI API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/) or via the UI. 
This orb aims to bring the maintainability aspect to these schedules by capturing the config natively within the CircleCI config.

## Pre-requisites

The intention of the orb is that it will be called from within the repository / project for which the schedule is to be created. Creating schedules for other repositories is not currently supported.

In order to create the schedule, you need to add a [CircleCI environment variable](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/) to the project which holds a [CircleCI API token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token) with write permissions to the target repository. Without this environment variable set, this orb will not be able to successfully create the schedule.

If not using the default environment variable `CIRCLECI_TOKEN`, please be sure to set the `circleci_token` parameter to your chosen environment variable in the orb job / command.

**Note** that the token must be a personal API token and not a project API token, as project tokens are not supported with V2 of the CircleCI API.

## Commands
### create_scheduled_pipeline

This is the only command that exists within this orb and makes use of a wrapper shell script to communicate with the CircleCI API to create your desired schedule based on what you've passed into the command parameters. This command is also wrapped within a job with the same name `create_scheduled_pipeline`.

This orb works with [dynamic pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/) and if the `config_path` parameter is set it will add the parameter `config-path` when the job is scheduled.
The `config.yaml` must have `setup: true` and expect the parameter `config-path`, the pipeline also needs to have this feature enabled in the project settings (details can be found [here](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/#getting-started-with-dynamic-config-in-circleci)).
The [team-cppe](https://github.com/ovotech/team-cppe/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml) repo is configured to do this.

**Parameters**
- `schedule_name` - Name of the schedule
- `schedule_description` - Description of the schedule
- `schedule_hour_frequency` - Number of times a schedule triggers per hour, value must be between 1 and 60
- `schedule_hours` - Comma separated hours in a day in which the schedule triggers
- `schedule_days` - Comma separated days in a week in which the schedule triggers
- `target_branch` - Branch on which the scheduled pipeline will trigger
- `circleci_token` - Environment variable containing CircleCI personal API token. If not set, will try and look for 
- `config_path` - Path of the scheduled scan config yml file (optional - set if using [dynamic pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/))"

## Examples

### Simple schedule for scheduled pipeline that runs weekly on Monday morning
```yaml
description: >
  Sample usage of the setup scheduled pipeline setup orb.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    setup-scheduled-pipeline: ovotech/setup-scheduled-pipeline@1.0.0
  workflows:
    example-workflow:
      jobs:
        - setup-scheduled-pipeline/create_scheduled_pipeline:
            schedule_name: '<REPO_NAME>-weekly-workflow'
            schedule_description: 'A weekly workflow on the main branch that executes once at 9 am every Monday'
            schedule_hour_frequency: '1'
            schedule_hours: '9'
            schedule_days: 'MON'
            target_branch: 'main'
            circleci_token: SERVICE_USER_CIRCLECI_TOKEN
            config_path: "circleci/scheduled_scan_config.yml"
```

## Consuming the schedule and adding workflow filtering

As a scheduled pipeline is essentially a triggered pipeline, by default it will run every workflow in the config.

To prevent this behaviour you can run workflows conditionally based on the pipeline values which will specify whether the pipeline is triggered by a desired schedule. For example:
```yaml

weekly-run-workflow:
  when:
    and:
      - equal: [ scheduled_pipeline, << pipeline.trigger_source >> ]
      - equal: [ "<REPO_NAME>-weekly-workflow", << pipeline.schedule.name >> ]
  jobs:
    - test
    - build
    - deploy
```
