# AWS CircleCI key rotate orb

This orb can be used to rotate AWS access keys and update corresponding CircleCI environment variables. A common use case would be to set up a scheduled CircleCI job which rotates access keys for the used user.

__Note__:  
CircleCI used to allow for AWS credentials to be entered separately, not as environment variables.  
If set these will be used by builds in preference of any AWS credentials that are set as environment variables.  
This can cause build failures after this Orb has rotated the environment variable values.  
 
Before using this Orb you should check that there are no AWS Credentials set on the deprecated settings page in CircleCI.  
The settings page is now hidden but can be accessed on a link similar to this:  
`https://circleci.com/gh/ovotech/<project name>/edit#aws` 

## Executors
This orb defines a small 'default' executor for running the aws commands. Any container that has `aws` cli, `curl` and `jq` can be used to run this orb.

## Commands
### rotate
This is the only command available in this orb. It rotates the AWS access keys for the user specified as the `aws-username` parameter. In addition of rotating the keys, this command also updates the corresponding environment variables. In order to run this command, you need to make sure that the aws cli client is already authenticated.

**Parameters**
- `aws-username` - user name of the AWS account you want to rotate keys for
- `circleci-token` - CircleCI API token used to update environment variables
- `aws-access-key-id-var` - name of the CircleCI environment variable which holds a value of the aws access key id, e.g. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `aws-secret-access-key-var` - name of the CircleCI environment variable which holds a value of the aws secret access key, e.g. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. 

## Examples
Make sure you have the following environment variables set up in CircleCI:
- CircleCI API token, e.g. `CIRCLECI_TOKEN`
- AWS access key id and a secret access key, e.g. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Your environment variables can have any name you want as long as you configure the aws cli and refrence correctly the names in the orb parameters (see the examples below).

The following example has the following CircleCI env vars `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` so they are automatically picked up by aws cli.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  rotate-aws-keys: ovotech/aws-rotate-keys@1

jobs:
  rotate-aws-keys:
    executor: rotate-aws-keys/default
    steps:
      - rotate-aws-keys/rotate:
          aws-username: circleci-user
          circleci-token: $CIRCLECI_TOKEN

workflows:
  version: 2
  rotate-weekly:
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          cron: "30 10 * * 3" # Every Wednesday at 10:30 UTC
          filters: { branches: { only: master } }
    jobs:
      - rotate-aws-keys
```

The following example uses the following CircleCI env variables `PROD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `PROD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` which are not automatically picked up by aws cli and therefore you need to set up the credentials manually.

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  rotate-aws-keys: ovotech/aws-rotate-keys@1

jobs:
  rotate-aws-keys:
    executor: rotate-aws-keys/default
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Set AWS environment to PROD
          command: |
            echo 'export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$PROD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' >> $BASH_ENV
            echo 'export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$PROD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' >> $BASH_ENV
      - rotate-aws-keys/rotate:
          aws-username: circleci-user
          circleci-token: $CIRCLECI_TOKEN
          aws-access-key-id-var: PROD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          aws-secret-access-key-var: PROD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

workflows:
  version: 2
  rotate-weekly:
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          cron: "30 10 * * 3" # Every Wednesday at 10:30 UTC
          filters: { branches: { only: master } }
    jobs:
      - rotate-aws-keys
```
